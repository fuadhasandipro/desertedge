        "h2": "What Is Tankless Water Heater Installation?",
        "body": "A tankless water heater is a type of water heating system that heats water only when needed, unlike traditional tank-style heaters that heat and reheat water constantly. This makes them more energy-efficient and cost-effective. They're also more compact and can be installed in smaller spaces, making them ideal for homes in Murrieta, CA's older neighborhoods. Additionally, tankless water heaters can last up to 15-20 years, compared to traditional tank-style heaters which typically last around 8-12 years. In Murrieta, CA's hard water environment, tankless water heaters are a better choice to prevent mineral buildup and extend the life of your system. Don't try to install one yourself, as improper installation can lead to costly repairs and even safety hazards."
