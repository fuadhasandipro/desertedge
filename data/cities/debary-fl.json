        "body": "DeBary, FL's high water table and porous soil make it an ideal location for sewer backups and overflows to occur. In neighborhoods like Pine Lakes and Heathrow, regular grease trap cleaning is essential to protect homes from costly water damage. The city's aging infrastructure, particularly in areas built in the 1950s and 1960s, also increases the risk of sewer backups. In addition, DeBary, FL's proximity to the coast and its sandy soil make it prone to storm surges and flooding, which can contaminate the water supply. Our professionals can clean your grease trap to ensure your plumbing system is functioning properly."
