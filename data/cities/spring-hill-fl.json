On Timber Pines Boulevard, where many homes were built in the 1960s and 1970s, older pipes are prone to corrosion and leaks. The risk of corrosion from hard water, which is prevalent in central and south Florida, further exacerbates the issue. In neighborhoods like Heritage Pines and Shady Hills, where homes are often surrounded by water tables and porous soil, a damaged sewer line can cause catastrophic damage.
