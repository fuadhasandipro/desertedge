        "body": "A tankless water heater is a space-saving, energy-efficient solution that heats water only when needed. Unlike traditional tank heaters, tankless systems don't store hot water, reducing the risk of leaks and water damage. Our experts install tankless water heaters in Carlsbad, NM, and surrounding areas, including Loving and Artesia. With a tankless system, you'll enjoy continuous hot water, even during peak usage. Local building codes require permits for most plumbing work, making a professional installation essential."
