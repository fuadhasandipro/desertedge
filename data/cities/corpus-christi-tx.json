        "body": "Backflow prevention refers to the measures taken to prevent contaminated water from flowing back into your potable water supply. This is particularly important in areas like Corpus Christi, TX, where the water table is high and the soil can shift, causing pipes to move and increasing the risk of backflow. The city's hard groundwater, with high mineral content, also poses a risk to your plumbing system.

Given these local conditions, it's clear that professional backflow prevention services are essential."
