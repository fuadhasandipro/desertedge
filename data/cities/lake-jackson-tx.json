        "body": "Lake Jackson, TX's sinks are particularly vulnerable to leaking due to the city's black clay soil and hard water. The city's aging housing stock, with many homes built in the 1970s and 1980s, also makes it more likely for sinks to leak. In fact, a study found that homes in Brazoria County, where Lake Jackson, TX is located, are more likely to experience sink leaks than homes in other parts of the state."
