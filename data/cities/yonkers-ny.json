For example, homes on Riverdale Avenue or Palisade Avenue may be more prone to plumbing issues due to the surrounding geography. Additionally, the city's water supply, which is relatively soft compared to other municipalities, can still cause scaling and corrosion in pipes, especially in areas like the 10708 ZIP code"
