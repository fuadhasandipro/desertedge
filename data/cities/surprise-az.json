In neighborhoods like Sun City West and El Mirage, where homes are built on slab-on-grade foundations, video pipe inspection is a safe and effective way to diagnose pipe issues and prevent future backups. The city's caliche soil also contributes to pipe shifting, making it essential to have a professional perform video pipe inspection. In Surprise AZ, where the average home age is over 20 years, pipe issues are a frequent problem, and DIY inspection is not recommended due to the high risk of further damage and safety hazards."
