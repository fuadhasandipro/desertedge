In neighborhoods like Mount Plymouth and Mount Dora, backflow prevention is essential to protect homes built in the 1950s and 60s, which often have older plumbing systems. The sandy, porous soil in these areas can cause pipes to shift and settle, increasing the risk of backflow. Additionally, the limestone aquifer that supplies water to central and south Florida can lead to hard water, which can also contribute to backflow issues."
