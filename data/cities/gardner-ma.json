In neighborhoods like South Ashburnham and Baldwinville, homes with older foundations are particularly susceptible to water damage. The city's municipal water supply and standard treatment also mean that water pressure can be unpredictable, making a professional sump pump installation even more crucial. Additionally, the soil in Gardner MA can be prone to settling, which can cause cracks in foundations and allow water to seep in."
