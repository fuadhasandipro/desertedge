        "body": "A tankless water heater is a compact, efficient unit that heats water only when needed. Unlike traditional tank water heaters, tankless systems don't store hot water, reducing the risk of leaks and corrosion. In Logan, UT, where municipal water supply is standard, a tankless water heater is a smart choice for homeowners. DIY installation is not recommended, as local building codes require permits for most plumbing work beyond minor repairs."
