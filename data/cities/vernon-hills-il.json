With many homes in the area built before WWII, galvanized pipes and cast iron drains are common, making them prone to leaks and corrosion. In fact, Chicago's combined sewer system can cause basement backups during heavy rain, making it essential to have a reliable plumber on standby. Furthermore, the soft but heavily treated water from Lake Michigan can lead to mineral buildup and pipe corrosion, increasing the risk of pipe issues. In neighborhoods like Indian Creek and Mettawa, where homes are often older and more susceptible to pipe issues, having a trusted pipe installation and repiping service is crucial."
